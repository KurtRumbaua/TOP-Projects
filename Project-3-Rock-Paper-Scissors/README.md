# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
![Game Demo](images/demo.gif)

A simple, interactive implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

# Disclaimer

Some parts of the code, particularly the CSS animations, were generated using AI. However, the majority of the project—including the game logic, layout structure, and CSS styling—was personally coded by me.

## 🎮 Project Overview

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum, which provides a free, open-source full-stack web development course. This implementation focuses on core JavaScript concepts and logic with simple UI.

## 🎲 How It Works

The game is a race to 5 points against the computer:

1. Players click on either Rock, Paper, or Scissors buttons
2. The selections animate with a "rolling" effect
3. The computer's choice is slightly biased to reduce ties (15% chance of tie vs 33% in purely random)
4. The result of each round is determined using classic Rock-Paper-Scissors rules:
   - 🪨 Rock beats ✂️ Scissors
   - 📄 Paper beats 🪨 Rock
   - ✂️ Scissors beats 📄 Paper
5. The first player to reach 5 points wins, triggering a victory/defeat screen
6. The game features a confetti celebration for wins 🎉

## ✨ Key Features

- Sleek UI: Modern dark-themed interface with smooth transitions
- Animations: Engaging animations for selections and results
- Sound Effects: Console-style sounds for hover, click, win, and lose
- Confetti: Celebrate victories with a colorful confetti display
- Typing Animation: Engaging start screen with animated text
- Score Tracking: Visual feedback after each round
- Anti-Tie Bias: Reduced probability of frustrating ties

## 💻 Technologies Used
```javascript
const technologies = {
  frontend: ["HTML5", "CSS3", "JavaScript (ES6+)"],
  animations: ["CSS Transitions", "Canvas API", "JavaScript Timers"],
  audio: ["Web Audio API"],
  design: ["Responsive Design", "Dark Theme"]
};
```

## 🎯Skills Demonstrated

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Open the game in a web browser
2. Click "Start Game" after the intro text finishes typing
3. Select Rock, Paper, or Scissors by clicking the buttons
4. First to 5 points wins!
5. Click "Play Again" to restart the game
