This landing page was created as part of the Foundations course from The Odin Project curriculum. In this project, I applied what I learned about basic HTML and CSS—especially Flexbox—to build a functional and responsive landing page.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to see the landing page.

## Usage
This project serves as a learning tool and practical implementation of foundational web development concepts. Feel free to explore, modify, and extend the code as needed.
