    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../images/lasagna.jpeg">
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish known for its layered structure and rich flavors. Traditionally made with
        sheets of pasta, lasagna is typically layered with a savory meat sauce, creamy b√©chamel or ricotta cheese, and a
        generous helping of mozzarella. The dish is baked until bubbling and golden, allowing the flavors to meld
        together beautifully. Each bite offers a delightful combination of textures, from the tender pasta to the creamy
        filling, making it a comfort food favorite.</p>
    <p>
        Lasagna is not only versatile but also customizable, allowing cooks to experiment with different ingredients.
        Variations can include vegetarian options, using spinach or mushrooms in place of meat, or even incorporating
        various cheeses for added depth of flavor. Additionally, lasagna can be prepared in advance and frozen, making
        it an ideal dish for meal prep or feeding a crowd. With its hearty nature and delicious taste, lasagna remains a
        beloved dish enjoyed by many around the world.
